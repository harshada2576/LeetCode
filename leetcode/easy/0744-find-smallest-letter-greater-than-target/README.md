# Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an array of characters `letters` that is sorted in  **non-decreasing order**, and a character `target`. There are  **at least two different**  characters in `letters`.

Return  *the smallest character in* `letters` *that is lexicographically greater than* `target`. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in `letters`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
Output: "f"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"
Output: "x"
Explanation: There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= letters.length <= 104
- letters[i] is a lowercase English letter.
- letters is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- letters contains at least two different characters.
- target is a lowercase English letter.

        int start = 0;
        int end = arr.length - 1;

        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            if (arr[mid] > x) {
                end = mid - 1;
            } else {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return arr[start % arr.length];
    }
}
