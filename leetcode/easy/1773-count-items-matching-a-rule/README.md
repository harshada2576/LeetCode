# Count Items Matching a Rule

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an array `items`, where each `items[i] = [typei, colori, namei]` describes the type, color, and name of the `ith` item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, `ruleKey` and `ruleValue`.

The `ith` item is said to match the rule if  **one**  of the following is true:

- ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
- ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
- ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.

Return  *the number of items that match the given rule*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are only two items matching the given rule, which are ["phone","blue","pixel"] and ["phone","gold","iphone"]. Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not match.
```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= items.length <= 104
- 1 <= typei.length, colori.length, namei.length, ruleValue.length <= 10
- ruleKey is equal to either "type", "color", or "name".
- All strings consist only of lowercase letters.

        //        int count = 0;
        int n = items.size();
        int col;
        if(ruleKey.equals("color")) {
            col = 1;
        }
        else if(ruleKey.equals("name")){
            col = 2;
        } 
        else{
            col = 0;
        }

        int count = 0;

        for(int i = 0 ; i < n;i++ ){
//            String val = items.get(i).get(col);
            if (items.get(i).get(col).equals(ruleValue)){
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
