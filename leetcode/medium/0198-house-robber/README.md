# House Robber

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and  **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return  *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight  **without alerting the police***.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 400

                 s=s+nums[i];
            }
            max=Math.max(s,max);

class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {

        int prev2 = 0;
        int prev1 = 0;

        for (int money : nums) {

            int robCurrent = money + prev2;
            int skipCurrent = prev1;

            int current = Math.max(robCurrent, skipCurrent);

            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = current;
        }

        return prev1;
    }
}
